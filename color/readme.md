You must have flask installed to run this application

Start a terminal at the directory "color." Run this code in the terminal with 
python server.py
or
python3 server.py (depending on your python installation)

The terminal will give you a URL to go to, probably this
http://127.0.0.1:5001

If you need to stop running the Flask application, go back to the terminal, and press Ctrl+C
